It was established as part of a JNF rehabilitation project.[19] In the early 1990s part of the valley was flooded again in the wake of heavy rains. It was decided to develop the surrounding area and leave the flooded area intact. The new site has become the second home for thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the stopover point for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake.",

Yotvata Hai-Bar can easily be visited by car or with a tour. \nThe purpose of the Yotvota Hai-Bar Nature Reserve is to breed and nurture endangered and locally extinct animals and then reintroduce them to the Negev Desert. There is a focus on animals mentioned in the Bible but the animals are not exclusively from Israel or the Middle East, the reserve also cares for, and breeds animals from other habitats around the world. Some of the animals who make Yotvata their home are the Oryx, ostrich, sand cat, gazelle and Arabian wolf and birds of prey like the Griffon vulture",

The colorful souk still trades as it has for hundreds of years with traders selling the whole spectrum of goods you might go to a shopping mall to purchase.  As you reach the seafront, you’ll see Akko’s Marina where tens of small, working fishing boats are docked. It is possible to take boat rides in Akko for a small fee and see the walls of the city from the water. If you want to stay on dry ground, take a stroll along the seafront atop the ancient walls. Pass the iconic spot where local kids famously jump into the water and watch fishermen trying to catch fish which are likely to end up on the table in one of the many fish restaurants found in and around the Old City",

The idea of the observatory was planned in 1972, it took careful planning to create the observatory without harming the natural environment. The observatory was built completely on land, which was then flooded with water from the Red Sea using armory parts and other metals. The base of the observatory was connected to large iron chains, and after the observatory was placed many corals were planted on and around the observatory in order to repair the damage that was done during the making of the observatory. The coral reef around the observatory flourished and became a major feeding spot for many fish and other marine wildlife, both carnivorous and herbivore.",

        description: "Crusader tower.\n The Crusader fortress on the hill overlooking the Roman theater was built in the 12th century on the foundation of an earlier Byzantine structure. The fortress is a large square structure, 15m x15m, and approximately 10 m. high. The lower portion of the building consists of reused antique spolia, including a sarcophagus with decorative carvings. The upper part of the structure and the doorway were added by Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century. Noticeable features from the rebuilding are the rounded corners which are similar to those constructed under Zahir in the fort in Shefa-'Amr. The upper part of the building was used as a school during the reign of Abdul Hamid II in the early 1900s (late Ottoman era), and used for this purpose until 1948.\nRoman and Byzantine city\n Much of the town has been excavated, revealing Jewish homes along a main cobblestone street. Several images have been found carved into the stones of the street, including that of a menorah, and another image that resembles some ancient game reminiscent of tic-tac-toe. Stepped pools have been uncovered throughout Sepphoris, and it is generally believed that these may well have been used as Mikva'ot, Jewish ritual baths.\nRoman theatre\nThe Roman theatre sits on the northern slope of the hill, and is about 45 m in diameter, seating 4500. Most of it is carved into the hillside, but some parts are supported by separate stone pillars. The theatre shows evidence of ancient damage, possibly from the earthquake in 363.\nNile mosaic villa\nA modern structure stands to one side of the excavations, overlooking the remains of a 5th-century public building with a large and intricate mosaic floor. Some believe the room was used for festival rituals involving a celebration of water, and possibly covering the floor in water. Drainage channels have been found in the floor, and the majority of the mosaic seems devoted to measuring the floods of the Nile, and celebrations of those floods.\nDionysus mosaic villa\nRevelers and attendants of the Dionysus party.A Roman villa, built around the year 200, contains an elaborate mosaic floor in what is believed to have been a triclinium. In Roman tradition, seating would have been arranged in a U-shape around the mosaic for guests to recline as they ate, drank and socialised. The mosaic features images of Dionysus, god of wine and of socialising, along with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels.The mosaic depicts a wine-drinking contest between Dionysus and Hercules. The most famous image is that of a young woman, possibly representing Venus, which has been dubbed the \"Mona Lisa of the Galilee\".Smaller mosaic tesserae were used, which allowed for greater detail and a more lifelike result, as seen in the shading and blush of her cheeks.",

        description: "The Banias Nature Reserve contains an abundance of natural and historical beauty, from the ruins of ancient cities to the roaring Banias Waterfall – the biggest waterfall in Israel. Found in the Upper Golan between the fertile Hula Valley and the Mount Hermon mountain area, the Banias is a favorite for those visiting the Golan. Hours can be spent at the Banias; walking the trails, exploring the ruins and picnicking in the lush green woodlands.\nThe Banias can be entered in two separate locations; the Falls and the Springs. The Falls entrance is the first one on the road heading northeast and allows one to visit the Banias Waterfall with ease – just a short walk down to the suspended trail. The Springs entrance takes one to the old temple complex that is now mere ruins of what once was a Greek and Roman testament to their rule of ancient Israel and their devotion to their gods. The name Banias is actually an Arabic corruption of the word Panias or Paneus – of the Greek god Pan, god of the forests and shepherds.\nBanias Falls Park -The Falls park entrance contains a large parking lot, facilities and a place to buy ice creams, snacks, and hot Druze pitas. Beyond the ticket gate (note: one ticket gains entrance to both park entrances) a trail leads down to the river, a 45-minute walk round-trip, including the suspended trail. A very unique way to approach a waterfall, the suspended trail was built along the basalt and travertine stone walls of the gorge, the roaring river just several meters below. The Banias Waterfalls are most impressive during the winter and spring when the water is most plentiful, on its way down to the Sea of Galilee. The waterfall is 10 meters (33 feet) high and during the winter and spring, the water crashes and mists down on those standing close on the observation deck. \nBanias Springs Park- The Springs park entrance contains a smaller parking lot, facilities and a gift shop. The wide mouth of Pan’s Cave can be seen from the road, making it easily identifiable. Before the cave, there is a calm series of stepped water, the Hermon stream, which can ever overflow onto the paved walkway. It is a peaceful and gorgeous entrance to the cave area. The ruins around the cave have been charted out to show the various temples and courts that were built and glorified by Agrippa II after the original site was founded by Herod’s son Philip who made the city Caesarea Philipi in the Banias. The cliff edge above the cave and ruins can be climbed, giving a birds-eye view of the park’s entrance and various trails and ruins.\nHikes at Banias-There are 4 trails that one can take within the Banias Nature Preserve, three of them 45-minutes long and one of them 90-minutes long.\n• Trail 1 – From the Springs Parking Lot to the Crusader city and back (45 minutes)\n• Trail 2 – From the Palace of Agrippa II to the Underground Passages and back to the Springs Parking Lot (45 minutes)\n• Trail 3 – From the Springs Parking Lot to the Banias Waterfalls (90 minutes)\n•	Trail 4 – From the Falls Parking Lot to the Banias Waterfalls and back (45 minutes)\n Note: Trail 3 goes from one parking lot to the other so be sure to have a car waiting for you unless you want to walk back another 90 minutes.\nTo be seen along the trails are places of interest such as the Officer’s Pool – a hot spring built by the Syrians and used by their officers, an ancient Roman bridge, a still-operational flour mill with olive press facilities as well, a hydroelectric station, gates, walls and moats from the Crusader and Mameluke times and an ancient synagogue on the outskirts of the ancient city ruins.",

These trails involve a little climbing so be prepared for something a little physically demanding. Along the way, water pools are popular with hikers who decide to stop and cool off. The sweet water pool in Dodim’s Cave is particularly beautiful.\nWhichever of the hikes you decide to take, you are likely to gaze in awe at the beauty of Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, and be amazed in particular at how it contrasts to its desert surroundings. The springs are a source of beauty today, and have, for thousands of years, been the source upon which life, both human and otherwise, has relied upon for living in the area.",

Jewish settlement in Tzfat dates back to the Temple period but Safed – pronounced “Tz-fat” in Hebrew – achieved fame and a reputation as the “City of Kabbalah” during the 16th century when the rabbis, Kabbalistic scholars and other Jews who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition made their home in the mountaintop town.\nTaking a walk through Safed\nVisitors today have a wide variety of opportunities to explore the city, its history and its meaning to the Jewish world, either with a guide or through their own self-guided walking tour. As well as the most popular sites – the Safed Artists Quarter and Safed Citadel, there are a host of more off-the-beaten track things to see in this city.\nTzfat Tourist Information Center\nThe Tzfat Visitors Center is located at 17 Alkabetz Street, just below the ARI Ashkanazi synagogue. The Center features a historical exhibition and provides maps, guidebooks and other information to tourists. Visitors can watch a 10-minute audio-visual presentation on the History of Safed at the Center, walk down into 16th century excavations and walk up to an observation deck which presents a stunning view of Northern Israel. The center is operated by Livnot U’Lehibanot, a unique experiential Israel Experience Program which offers program options to young Jewish adults who are interested in participating in excavations, volunteer activities, hiking and Jewish exploration.\nInternational Center of Tzfat Kabbalah\nThe Center brings the study of Kabbalah back to its Jewish roots with staff members who offer teaches followers how to strengthen their relationship with God and their fellow man. The Center offers a 15-minute audio-visual presentation which provides an overview of Kabbalah for beginners. The Center is located on the second floor of the Fig Tree Gallery on Alkabetz Street.\nAscent InstituteThe Ascent Institute features daily classes on different aspects of Kabbalah, traditional Judaism and Hassidic thought. There are accommodations available for Jewish travelers who want to take advantage of a low-cost \nhostel while they learn more about their heritage. There is a library with a staff rabbi where people of any religious background can ask questions about Judaism and find out the meaning of their name according to Bible codes. Ascent is located at 2 HaAri Street. Read more at www.zissil.com\nHaARI Ashkanazi Synagogue\nHaARI Ashkanazi Synagogue was once called the “Grigoris Synagogue.” It was established by Jews who had converted to Christianity under duress under the Spanish Inquisition and subsequently escaped. When they made their way to Tzfat they were not immediately accepted by the Safed community so they built their own synagogue. The famous Kabbalistic rabbi Rabbi Isaac Luria (the ARI) celebrated the Kabbalat Shabbat service with his students next to the synagogue and after his death the synagogue was renamed\nThe Kahal National Heritage Site\nExcavations are underway near the Abuhav synagogue which have uncovered an entire 16th century Jewish neighborhood. This site has been named a National Heritage Site of Israel and will be developed into an educational village that will contain information and interactive exhibits to depict Jewish life of Safed’s Golden Age and its influences on today’s Jewish world. A sample of the excavations, along with more information, can be obtained at the Tzfat Tourist Information Center. The Kahal is being excavated by the Livnot U’Lehibanot Israel Experience Program.\ntam Center\nThe Stam Center is located outside of the Old Jewish Quarter on Gedud HaSlishi street, approximately a 10 minute drive from the Old City. The center shows interactive exhibitions and audio-visual presentations of the art of “sofer stam” – making the parchments which Jews place in their mezuzzas and tefillin as well as the creation of Torah scrolls",

It was decided to develop the surrounding area and leave the flooded area intact. The new site has become the second home for thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the stopover point for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake.",

The base of the observatory was connected to large iron chains, and after the observatory was placed many corals were planted on and around the observatory in order to repair the damage that was done during the making of the observatory.

The fortress is a large square structure, 15m x15m, and approximately 10 m. high. The lower portion of the building consists of reused antique spolia, including a sarcophagus with decorative carvings. The upper part of the structure and the doorway were added by Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century. Noticeable features from the rebuilding are the rounded corners which are similar to those constructed under Zahir in the fort in Shefa-'Amr. The upper part of the building was used as a school during the reign of Abdul Hamid II in the early 1900s (late Ottoman era), and used for this purpose until 1948.\nRoman and Byzantine city\n Much of the town has been excavated, revealing Jewish homes along a main cobblestone street. Several images have been found carved into the stones of the street, including that of a menorah, and another image that resembles some ancient game reminiscent of tic-tac-toe. Stepped pools have been uncovered throughout Sepphoris, and it is generally believed that these may well have been used as Mikva'ot, Jewish ritual baths.\nRoman theatre\nThe Roman theatre sits on the northern slope of the hill, and is about 45 m in diameter, seating 4500. Most of it is carved into the hillside, but some parts are supported by separate stone pillars. The theatre shows evidence of ancient damage, possibly from the earthquake in 363.\nNile mosaic villa\nA modern structure stands to one side of the excavations, overlooking the remains of a 5th-century public building with a large and intricate mosaic floor. Some believe the room was used for festival rituals involving a celebration of water, and possibly covering the floor in water. Drainage channels have been found in the floor, and the majority of the mosaic seems devoted to measuring the floods of the Nile, and celebrations of those floods.\nDionysus mosaic villa\nRevelers and attendants of the Dionysus party.A Roman villa, built around the year 200, contains an elaborate mosaic floor in what is believed to have been a triclinium. In Roman tradition, seating would have been arranged in a U-shape around the mosaic for guests to recline as they ate, drank and socialised. The mosaic features images of Dionysus, god of wine and of socialising, along with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels.The mosaic depicts a wine-drinking contest between Dionysus and Hercules. The most famous image is that of a young woman, possibly representing Venus, which has been dubbed the \"Mona Lisa of the Galilee\".Smaller mosaic tesserae were used, which allowed for greater detail and a more lifelike result, as seen in the shading and blush of her cheeks.",

        description: "The Banias Nature Reserve contains an abundance of natural and historical beauty, from the ruins of ancient cities to the roaring Banias Waterfall – the biggest waterfall in Israel. Found in the Upper Golan between the fertile Hula Valley and the Mount Hermon mountain area, the Banias is a favorite for those visiting the Golan. Hours can be spent at the Banias; walking the trails, exploring the ruins and picnicking in the lush green woodlands.\nThe Banias can be entered in two separate locations; the Falls and the Springs. The Falls entrance is the first one on the road heading northeast and allows one to visit the Banias Waterfall with ease – just a short walk down to the suspended trail. The Springs entrance takes one to the old temple complex that is now mere ruins of what once was a Greek and Roman testament to their rule of ancient Israel and their devotion to their gods. The name Banias is actually an Arabic corruption of the word Panias or Paneus – of the Greek god Pan, god of the forests and shepherds.\nBanias Falls Park -The Falls park entrance contains a large parking lot, facilities and a place to buy ice creams, snacks, and hot Druze pitas. Beyond the ticket gate (note: one ticket gains entrance to both park entrances) a trail leads down to the river, a 45-minute walk round-trip, including the suspended trail. A very unique way to approach a waterfall, the suspended trail was built along the basalt and travertine stone walls of the gorge, the roaring river just several meters below. The Banias Waterfalls are most impressive during the winter and spring when the water is most plentiful, on its way down to the Sea of Galilee. The waterfall is 10 meters (33 feet) high and during the winter and spring, the water crashes and mists down on those standing close on the observation deck. \nBanias Springs Park- The Springs park entrance contains a smaller parking lot, facilities and a gift shop. The wide mouth of Pan’s Cave can be seen from the road, making it easily identifiable. Before the cave, there is a calm series of stepped water, the Hermon stream, which can ever overflow onto the paved walkway. It is a peaceful and gorgeous entrance to the cave area. The ruins around the cave have been charted out to show the various temples and courts that were built and glorified by Agrippa II after the original site was founded by Herod’s son Philip who made the city Caesarea Philipi in the Banias. The cliff edge above the cave and ruins can be climbed, giving a birds-eye view of the park’s entrance and various trails and ruins.\nHikes at Banias-There are 4 trails that one can take within the Banias Nature Preserve, three of them 45-minutes long and one of them 90-minutes long.\n• Trail 1 – From the Springs Parking Lot to the Crusader city and back (45 minutes)\n• Trail 2 – From the Palace of Agrippa II to the Underground Passages and back to the Springs Parking Lot (45 minutes)\n• Trail 3 – From the Springs Parking Lot to the Banias Waterfalls (90 minutes)\n•	Trail 4 – From the Falls Parking Lot to the Banias Waterfalls and back (45 minutes)\n Note: Trail 3 goes from one parking lot to the other so be sure to have a car waiting for you unless you want to walk back another 90 minutes.\nTo be seen along the trails are places of interest such as the Officer’s Pool – a hot spring built by the Syrians and used by their officers, an ancient Roman bridge, a still-operational flour mill with olive press facilities as well, a hydroelectric station, gates, walls and moats from the Crusader and Mameluke times and an ancient synagogue on the outskirts of the ancient city ruins.",

These trails involve a little climbing so be prepared for something a little physically demanding. Along the way, water pools are popular with hikers who decide to stop and cool off. The sweet water pool in Dodim’s Cave is particularly beautiful.\nWhichever of the hikes you decide to take, you are likely to gaze in awe at the beauty of Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, and be amazed in particular at how it contrasts to its desert surroundings. The springs are a source of beauty today, and have, for thousands of years, been the source upon which life, both human and otherwise, has relied upon for living in the area.",

Jewish settlement in Tzfat dates back to the Temple period but Safed – pronounced “Tz-fat” in Hebrew – achieved fame and a reputation as the “City of Kabbalah” during the 16th century when the rabbis, Kabbalistic scholars and other Jews who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition made their home in the mountaintop town.\nTaking a walk through Safed\nVisitors today have a wide variety of opportunities to explore the city, its history and its meaning to the Jewish world, either with a guide or through their own self-guided walking tour. As well as the most popular sites – the Safed Artists Quarter and Safed Citadel, there are a host of more off-the-beaten track things to see in this city.\nTzfat Tourist Information Center\nThe Tzfat Visitors Center is located at 17 Alkabetz Street, just below the ARI Ashkanazi synagogue. The Center features a historical exhibition and provides maps, guidebooks and other information to tourists. Visitors can watch a 10-minute audio-visual presentation on the History of Safed at the Center, walk down into 16th century excavations and walk up to an observation deck which presents a stunning view of Northern Israel. The center is operated by Livnot U’Lehibanot, a unique experiential Israel Experience Program which offers program options to young Jewish adults who are interested in participating in excavations, volunteer activities, hiking and Jewish exploration.\nInternational Center of Tzfat Kabbalah\nThe Center brings the study of Kabbalah back to its Jewish roots with staff members who offer teaches followers how to strengthen their relationship with God and their fellow man. The Center offers a 15-minute audio-visual presentation which provides an overview of Kabbalah for beginners. The Center is located on the second floor of the Fig Tree Gallery on Alkabetz Street.\nAscent InstituteThe Ascent Institute features daily classes on different aspects of Kabbalah, traditional Judaism and Hassidic thought. There are accommodations available for Jewish travelers who want to take advantage of a low-cost \nhostel while they learn more about their heritage. There is a library with a staff rabbi where people of any religious background can ask questions about Judaism and find out the meaning of their name according to Bible codes. Ascent is located at 2 HaAri Street. Read more at www.zissil.com\nHaARI Ashkanazi Synagogue\nHaARI Ashkanazi Synagogue was once called the “Grigoris Synagogue.” It was established by Jews who had converted to Christianity under duress under the Spanish Inquisition and subsequently escaped. When they made their way to Tzfat they were not immediately accepted by the Safed community so they built their own synagogue. The famous Kabbalistic rabbi Rabbi Isaac Luria (the ARI) celebrated the Kabbalat Shabbat service with his students next to the synagogue and after his death the synagogue was renamed\nThe Kahal National Heritage Site\nExcavations are underway near the Abuhav synagogue which have uncovered an entire 16th century Jewish neighborhood. This site has been named a National Heritage Site of Israel and will be developed into an educational village that will contain information and interactive exhibits to depict Jewish life of Safed’s Golden Age and its influences on today’s Jewish world. A sample of the excavations, along with more information, can be obtained at the Tzfat Tourist Information Center. The Kahal is being excavated by the Livnot U’Lehibanot Israel Experience Program.\ntam Center\nThe Stam Center is located outside of the Old Jewish Quarter on Gedud HaSlishi street, approximately a 10 minute drive from the Old City. The center shows interactive exhibitions and audio-visual presentations of the art of “sofer stam” – making the parchments which Jews place in their mezuzzas and tefillin as well as the creation of Torah scrolls",

It was decided to develop the surrounding area and leave the flooded area intact. The new site has become the second home for thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the stopover point for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake.",

The base of the observatory was connected to large iron chains, and after the observatory was placed many corals were planted on and around the observatory in order to repair the damage that was done during the making of the observatory.

The fortress is a large square structure, 15m x15m, and approximately 10 m. high. The lower portion of the building consists of reused antique spolia, including a sarcophagus with decorative carvings. The upper part of the structure and the doorway were added by Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century. Noticeable features from the rebuilding are the rounded corners which are similar to those constructed under Zahir in the fort in Shefa-'Amr. The upper part of the building was used as a school during the reign of Abdul Hamid II in the early 1900s (late Ottoman era), and used for this purpose until 1948.\nRoman and Byzantine city\n Much of the town has been excavated, revealing Jewish homes along a main cobblestone street. Several images have been found carved into the stones of the street, including that of a menorah, and another image that resembles some ancient game reminiscent of tic-tac-toe. Stepped pools have been uncovered throughout Sepphoris, and it is generally believed that these may well have been used as Mikva'ot, Jewish ritual baths.\nRoman theatre\nThe Roman theatre sits on the northern slope of the hill, and is about 45 m in diameter, seating 4500. Most of it is carved into the hillside, but some parts are supported by separate stone pillars. The theatre shows evidence of ancient damage, possibly from the earthquake in 363.\nNile mosaic villa\nA modern structure stands to one side of the excavations, overlooking the remains of a 5th-century public building with a large and intricate mosaic floor. Some believe the room was used for festival rituals involving a celebration of water, and possibly covering the floor in water. Drainage channels have been found in the floor, and the majority of the mosaic seems devoted to measuring the floods of the Nile, and celebrations of those floods.\nDionysus mosaic villa\nRevelers and attendants of the Dionysus party.A Roman villa, built around the year 200, contains an elaborate mosaic floor in what is believed to have been a triclinium. In Roman tradition, seating would have been arranged in a U-shape around the mosaic for guests to recline as they ate, drank and socialised. The mosaic features images of Dionysus, god of wine and of socialising, along with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels.The mosaic depicts a wine-drinking contest between Dionysus and Hercules. The most famous image is that of a young woman, possibly representing Venus, which has been dubbed the \"Mona Lisa of the Galilee\".Smaller mosaic tesserae were used, which allowed for greater detail and a more lifelike result, as seen in the shading and blush of her cheeks.",

        description: "The Banias Nature Reserve contains an abundance of natural and historical beauty, from the ruins of ancient cities to the roaring Banias Waterfall – the biggest waterfall in Israel. Found in the Upper Golan between the fertile Hula Valley and the Mount Hermon mountain area, the Banias is a favorite for those visiting the Golan. Hours can be spent at the Banias; walking the trails, exploring the ruins and picnicking in the lush green woodlands.\nThe Banias can be entered in two separate locations; the Falls and the Springs. The Falls entrance is the first one on the road heading northeast and allows one to visit the Banias Waterfall with ease – just a short walk down to the suspended trail. The Springs entrance takes one to the old temple complex that is now mere ruins of what once was a Greek and Roman testament to their rule of ancient Israel and their devotion to their gods. The name Banias is actually an Arabic corruption of the word Panias or Paneus – of the Greek god Pan, god of the forests and shepherds.\nBanias Falls Park -The Falls park entrance contains a large parking lot, facilities and a place to buy ice creams, snacks, and hot Druze pitas. Beyond the ticket gate (note: one ticket gains entrance to both park entrances) a trail leads down to the river, a 45-minute walk round-trip, including the suspended trail. A very unique way to approach a waterfall, the suspended trail was built along the basalt and travertine stone walls of the gorge, the roaring river just several meters below. The Banias Waterfalls are most impressive during the winter and spring when the water is most plentiful, on its way down to the Sea of Galilee. The waterfall is 10 meters (33 feet) high and during the winter and spring, the water crashes and mists down on those standing close on the observation deck. \nBanias Springs Park- The Springs park entrance contains a smaller parking lot, facilities and a gift shop. The wide mouth of Pan’s Cave can be seen from the road, making it easily identifiable. Before the cave, there is a calm series of stepped water, the Hermon stream, which can ever overflow onto the paved walkway. It is a peaceful and gorgeous entrance to the cave area. The ruins around the cave have been charted out to show the various temples and courts that were built and glorified by Agrippa II after the original site was founded by Herod’s son Philip who made the city Caesarea Philipi in the Banias. The cliff edge above the cave and ruins can be climbed, giving a birds-eye view of the park’s entrance and various trails and ruins.\nHikes at Banias-There are 4 trails that one can take within the Banias Nature Preserve, three of them 45-minutes long and one of them 90-minutes long.\n• Trail 1 – From the Springs Parking Lot to the Crusader city and back (45 minutes)\n• Trail 2 – From the Palace of Agrippa II to the Underground Passages and back to the Springs Parking Lot (45 minutes)\n• Trail 3 – From the Springs Parking Lot to the Banias Waterfalls (90 minutes)\n•	Trail 4 – From the Falls Parking Lot to the Banias Waterfalls and back (45 minutes)\n Note: Trail 3 goes from one parking lot to the other so be sure to have a car waiting for you unless you want to walk back another 90 minutes.\nTo be seen along the trails are places of interest such as the Officer’s Pool – a hot spring built by the Syrians and used by their officers, an ancient Roman bridge, a still-operational flour mill with olive press facilities as well, a hydroelectric station, gates, walls and moats from the Crusader and Mameluke times and an ancient synagogue on the outskirts of the ancient city ruins.",

There’s no doubt that Ein Gedi Nature Reserve is one of the most beautiful places in Israel. While it is located close to Jerusalem, it feels worlds away, Ein Gedi is, of course, one of the most popular escape spots for locals and tourists who take advantage of the reserve, botanical gardens, and the Dead Sea.\n\nWhile the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve offers over nine different hiking trails, suitable for everyone from family groups to experienced hikers, and ranging in duration from just half an hour in length to a full day, some of the most popular hiking trails are those which head through Wadi David.\nThe following route is split into two, the first section is suitable for all hikers, whilst the second section is a slightly more challenging “moderate” hike.\nThe first section of the Wadi David Hike (the ‘lower section’) is a scenic hike from the Wadi David ticket office to David’s Waterfall. A circular walk, it’s a pretty walk which is expected to take no longer than one hour to complete.",

Continuing from David’s Fall you head onto more difficult trails towards Shulamit’s Spring, Dodim’s Cave, and finally, the Ein Gedi Spring. These trails involve a little climbing so be prepared for something a little physically demanding. Along the way, water pools are popular with hikers who decide to stop and cool off. The sweet water pool in Dodim’s Cave is particularly beautiful.\nWhichever of the hikes you decide to take, you are likely to gaze in awe at the beauty of Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, and be amazed in particular at how it contrasts to its desert surroundings. The springs are a source of beauty today, and have, for thousands of years, been the source upon which life, both human and otherwise, has relied upon for living in the area.",

Since the re-introduction program began, Persian fallow deer have been living in the Galilee and the Judean mountains, and roe deer on the Carmel, but it is difficult to see them in the wild. A visit to the Carmel Hay-Bar is an opportunity to take a close look at these noble animals.\n• A close view of the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), which are endangered birds in Israel. The vultures bred at the Carmel Hay-Bar are reintroduced into the wild as part of a nation-wide project called “Taking Israeli Raptors Under our Wing”. The purpose of the project is to increase the population of vultures which has declined in Israel in the last few decades.\n• Viewing the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella gazella) which is an endangered species. Some of the individuals bred at the Carmel Hay-Bar are eventually reintroduced into the wild.\n• Viewing other raptors: White-tailed eagle (Haliaetus albicilla), Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata), and others.\n• Viewing wild goats (Capra aegagrus) and wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) – herbivores living at the Carmel Hay-bar in fenced enclosures.",

        description: "Taking a walk through Safed, the northern city which is a major point of interest for many visitors to Israel who journey to the town to enjoy the cobbled stone alleys, the art, the historical sites and the mystical atmosphere of this ancient city. Jewish settlement in Tzfat dates back to the Temple period but Safed – pronounced “Tz-fat” in Hebrew – achieved fame and a reputation as the “City of Kabbalah” during the 16th century when the rabbis, Kabbalistic scholars and other Jews who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition made their home in the mountaintop town.\nTaking a walk through Safed\nVisitors today have a wide variety of opportunities to explore the city, its history and its meaning to the Jewish world, either with a guide or through their own self-guided walking tour. As well as the most popular sites – the Safed Artists Quarter and Safed Citadel, there are a host of more off-the-beaten track things to see in this city.\nTzfat Tourist Information Center\nThe Tzfat Visitors Center is located at 17 Alkabetz Street, just below the ARI Ashkanazi synagogue. The Center features a historical exhibition and provides maps, guidebooks and other information to tourists. Visitors can watch a 10-minute audio-visual presentation on the History of Safed at the Center, walk down into 16th century excavations and walk up to an observation deck which presents a stunning view of Northern Israel. The center is operated by Livnot U’Lehibanot, a unique experiential Israel Experience Program which offers program options to young Jewish adults who are interested in participating in excavations, volunteer activities, hiking and Jewish exploration.\nInternational Center of Tzfat Kabbalah\nThe Center brings the study of Kabbalah back to its Jewish roots with staff members who offer teaches followers how to strengthen their relationship with God and their fellow man. The Center offers a 15-minute audio-visual presentation which provides an overview of Kabbalah for beginners. The Center is located on the second floor of the Fig Tree Gallery on Alkabetz Street.\nAscent InstituteThe Ascent Institute features daily classes on different aspects of Kabbalah, traditional Judaism and Hassidic thought. There are accommodations available for Jewish travelers who want to take advantage of a low-cost \nhostel while they learn more about their heritage. There is a library with a staff rabbi where people of any religious background can ask questions about Judaism and find out the meaning of their name according to Bible codes. Ascent is located at 2 HaAri Street. Read more at www.zissil.com\nHaARI Ashkanazi Synagogue\nHaARI Ashkanazi Synagogue was once called the “Grigoris Synagogue.” It was established by Jews who had converted to Christianity under duress under the Spanish Inquisition and subsequently escaped. When they made their way to Tzfat they were not immediately accepted by the Safed community so they built their own synagogue. The famous Kabbalistic rabbi Rabbi Isaac Luria (the ARI) celebrated the Kabbalat Shabbat service with his students next to the synagogue and after his death the synagogue was renamed\nThe Kahal National Heritage Site\nExcavations are underway near the Abuhav synagogue which have uncovered an entire 16th century Jewish neighborhood. This site has been named a National Heritage Site of Israel and will be developed into an educational village that will contain information and interactive exhibits to depict Jewish life of Safed’s Golden Age and its influences on today’s Jewish world. A sample of the excavations, along with more information, can be obtained at the Tzfat Tourist Information Center. The Kahal is being excavated by the Livnot U’Lehibanot Israel Experience Program.\ntam Center\nThe Stam Center is located outside of the Old Jewish Quarter on Gedud HaSlishi street, approximately a 10 minute drive from the Old City. The center shows interactive exhibitions and audio-visual presentations of the art of “sofer stam” – making the parchments which Jews place in their mezuzzas and tefillin as well as the creation of Torah scrolls",
